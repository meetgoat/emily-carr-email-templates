	<h2>Ahnahktsipiitaa's This is Not a Ceremony to Premiere at Sundance Film Festival</h2>
	<p>A new cinematic virtual reality (VR) experience by artist and filmmaker Ahnahktsipiitaa (Colin Van Loon) will make its world premiere this month at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival.</p>
	<p>Titled This is Not a Ceremony, the stunning immersive work takes viewers inside the stories of two Indigenous men whose lives were shaped — and in one case cut short — by structural racism.</p>
	<p>Speaking via Zoom in December, Ahnahktsipiitaa says his overarching goal with This is Not a Ceremony is to bring viewers into intimate contact with specific people. Putting a human face to Indigenous trauma is one way to help ensure the same harms aren’t repeated, he adds.</p>
	<p>“Because if viewers can know these people better, know them more closely, then how could they treat them like that?” he says. Though the story walks a fine line; Indigenous people vulnerable to retraumatization by irresponsible media depictions of their lives and loss. This is Not a Ceremony, Ahnahktsipiitaa says, aims to foreground the courage and perseverance of its subjects as much as the magnitude of their pain.</p>
	<p>“The last thing I want do is retraumatize the storytellers,” he continues. “This piece is made for Indigenous people to see the strength and resilience of these men. And this piece is made to be something of a wake-up call, a call-to-action for settlers.”</p>

	<p>Lauren’s practice focuses on painted portraiture, experimental mapmaking and immersive installation. Her background includes working with youth, radio programming and illustration.</p>
	<p>The purpose of the work she has done thus far has been to examine the function of colonialism in portraiture and other histories that aren’t always truthful representations of Indigenous existence. As such, Lauren’s portraits describe Indigenous people as they appear to her. Through her work she celebrates nuanced experiences, and seeks a sincere understanding of the many facets of Indigenous life.</p>
